All App charges appear on your regular Shopify subscription bill. Each store has a free 30-day trial. After that, your first active subscription period will begin the following day.</p><p></p><p>On theUnlimited plan, the first usage fee is created by OCU in thenext 6 hoursafter the active period has started.</p><a href=""#h_cde2b8a638"">Unlimited plan</a><p></p><p>For example:If the free trial finishes on December 1st, then the active period starts on December 2nd. The first usage fee will be created on December 2nd. The first invoice will be $35ifthe upsell revenue for thefirst 6 hoursis less than or equal to $1,000. If upsell revenue is $1,000.01 or greater, then the first usage fee will be $99 (the next pricing tier).</p><p></p><p>Next, the OCU app checks upsell revenue every 6 hours and then creates the next usage fee record when thenext pricing tier thresholdis reached.</p><p></p><p>For example:Your store earned $100 in upsell revenue in the first 6 hours (December 2nd in the example). This means that the first usage fee invoice will be $35. Then, your store earned more than $1,000.01 on December 6th. The next usage fee invoice will be created on December 6th. The usage fee invoice amount isthe differencebetween tier prices I.e. $99 - $35 =$64.00.</p><p></p><p>Based on the first example, on December 6th your store would now havetwo usage fees, with atotal sum of $99because upsell revenue is greater than $1,000.00 but less than $5,000.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the 30-day app billing period, your store will/can haveseveral usage fees,with the total sum of those invoices being equal to the OCU pricing tier based on upsell revenue generated for the app billing cycle.</p><p></p><p>View Shopify's information regardingbilling for Appsin their help article linked below:</p><p></p><a href=""https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/manage-billing/your-invoice/apps"">Shopify Help Center - App charges</a><p>For more information on what Shopify charges you each month in general, view theirUnderstanding your Shopify billarticle linked to below:</p><p></p><a href=""https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/manage-billing/your-invoice"">Understanding Your Shopify Bill</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>Total Cost of using OCU</h2><p>Thetotal costof using OCU is as follows:</p><ul><li>Monthly subscription fee:​$8/month forStarterStarts at $35/month forUnlimitedand increases based on total upsell revenue generated per month.​📝 Pricing is based on the total upsell revenue your store processes in a 30-day billing cycle,notthe number of orders processed.</li><li>$8/month forStarter</li><li>Starts at $35/month forUnlimitedand increases based on total upsell revenue generated per month.​📝 Pricing is based on the total upsell revenue your store processes in a 30-day billing cycle,notthe number of orders processed.</li></ul><p>Monthly subscription fee:​</p><ul><li>$8/month forStarter</li><li>Starts at $35/month forUnlimitedand increases based on total upsell revenue generated per month.​📝 Pricing is based on the total upsell revenue your store processes in a 30-day billing cycle,notthe number of orders processed.</li></ul><p>$8/month forStarter</p><p>Starts at $35/month forUnlimitedand increases based on total upsell revenue generated per month.​📝 Pricing is based on the total upsell revenue your store processes in a 30-day billing cycle,notthe number of orders processed.</p><ul><li>Per-transaction fee for each post-purchase offer added:​Transaction fees vary based on yourShopify plan typeand on which credit card processor you are using (i.e. Shopify Payments for the Shopify Basic plan is 2.9% + 30¢ USD for each successful credit card charge).📝 Each post-purchase offer the customer buys is considered a separate transaction I.e. the initial checkout charge is one transaction, Post-purchase Upsell 1 is a second transaction, and Post-purchase Upsell 2 is the third transaction.

You can still offer pre-purchase without a discount or use the Shopify Compare at Price option to avoid the creation of a Draft Order Checkout.</p><p></p><p>🚫 Merchants who use store-wide Shopify Automatic Discounts</p><p>Automatic Discounts cannot be applied to a Draft order.

OCU has many creative solutions that help trigger and display the best products to your customers throughout the upsell funnel.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>What is a Trigger?</h2><p></p><p>A “Trigger” is a term we use to identify the store product(s) or cart condition(s) that cause a particular Upsell Funnel to be displayed. You get to select your Trigger Conditions and which offers they display each time you create or edit a new Upsell Funnel.Check out this help docfor more information on setting up funnel conditions and triggers.</p><a href=""https://help.zipify.com/en/articles/6381023-oneclickupsell-trigger-types-conditions"">Check out this help doc</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>Can I set all of my products as a trigger?</h2><p></p><p>We don’t limit the number of funnels you can create! You can set up a funnel for each of the products on your store. You can also set the funnel to trigger based on if a product is in a specific collection, the number of items in the cart, the total value of the items in the cart, or even your customer's location!</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>What if a customer adds several different funnel trigger products to the cart?</h2><p></p><p>If an order contains multiple OCU trigger products, the upsell funnel that will be shown to the customer is determined by theFunnel Prioritysetting. In this case, the trigger product associated with the funnel with the highest priority will determine what is shown to your customer.</p><a href=""https://help.zipify.com/en/articles/6380917-oneclickupsell-funnels-overview#h_c8f8b8d27d"">Funnel Priority</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>How many pre-purchase offers can I show to a customer per order?</h2><p></p><p>You can present 1 pre-purchase upsell popup on the Cart Page and/or on the Product page.

If the customer buys Upsell 1, then Upsell 2 will be shown next. If the customer declines Upsell 1, then your Downsell will be shown next instead of Upsell 2.</p><p></p><p>We recommend adding all 3 post-purchase offers to your funnel to maximize AOV.Click hereto check out a sweet diagram of the offer sequence that we made for you!</p><a href=""https://help.zipify.com/en/articles/6381036-oneclickupsell-adding-offers-into-a-funnel#h_db7c3eb485"">Click here</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>What is the difference between an upsell and a downsell?</h2><p></p><p>Anupsellis an offer for more products after the initial purchase, either at a discounted rate or as a part of a bundle.  Adownsellis an offer shown if a customer has declined the first upsell. Typically, the downsell is a lower-priced option compared to what you've just offered.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>Can I show an upsell offer on the Shopify Checkout page?</h2><p></p><p>Shopify Plus merchants with “Checkout extensibility” enabled can offer In-Checkout offers.

We have high-converting Thank You Page offers that can be configured to Show on the Shopify TY Page (Order Confirmation).Check out this articlefor more about how those offers work.</p><a href=""https://help.zipify.com/en/articles/5042995-oneclickupsell-working-with-the-ty-page-offer-editor"">Check out this article</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>What is the difference between a Post-Purchase offer and a Thank You Page offer?</h2><p></p><p>A Post-Purchase offer can be accepted with one click - the customer does not have to re-enter their payment information a second time. If the customer accepts a Thank you Page offer, they will be redirected back to the final page of the Shopify checkout to re-enter their payment information to make the purchase.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>Will you build this out for me?</h2><p></p><p>Solo entrepreneurs find our intuitive design, knowledge base, and AI recommendations (in beta) so well done they go the DIY route. Larger teams tend to have a team member delegated to build OCU upsells. You can also enlist the assistance of an Account Manager on our OCU Plan for expert strategy and ongoing funnel optimization planning.</p><p></p><p>What is OCU Plus?Click herefor details and pricing.</p><a href=""https://zipify.com/apps/ocu-plus/"">Click here</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>Working with Shopify Orders</h2><p>Once you've got all your funnels set up, you'll probably be wondering how it all works and how adding OCU might affect your current Shopify flow. Let's talk about it!</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>Do Post-Purchase offers get added to the original order or are new orders created?</h2><p></p><p>All post-purchase offers are added to the original Shopify order through Shopify’sedit order API. So you and your customers don’t have to worry about managing multiple orders or shipments.</p><a href=""https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/order-editing"">edit order API</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>So how does it work if I have auto-fulfillment setup to fulfill my order once it’s complete?</h2><p></p><p>Shopify’s Fulfillment API puts the order on hold and releases it automatically once the post-purchase sequence is finished. This means OCU will work smoothly with most 3rd party fulfillment apps as long as they are using the Shopify Fulfillment API. Learn more.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>If the customer doesn’t want the post-purchase upsell (closes their browser window after the initial checkout), can I lose my initial sale?</h2><p></p><p>No. The one-click post-purchase offer is shown only after the customer has already completed their initial purchase, so you can never lose your initial sale!</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>Can the customer bypass the post-purchase offer funnel?</h2><p></p><p>Yes. The customer can bypass the post-purchase funnel at any time by clicking the ""View order confirmation >"" link included at the top of each post-purchase offer page. The customer can also simply close their browser window or tab after completing the initial checkout order.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>Can the customer’s payment be declined when accepting the post-purchase offer?</h2><p></p><p>Yes. There are a number of reasons why the customer’s payment can be declined. In that case, the post-purchase offer will still be added to the order and you’ll have an opportunity to collect payment from the customer through a payment URL. More details on what happens with Partially Paid orders are here.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>Do Discount codes applied to the Shopify Checkout affect the one-click post-purchase Upsell/Downsell product price?</h2><p></p><p>No. The Discount code applied at Shopify Checkout applies to the item(s) included in the Checkout only. Post-purchase offer page(s) have their own ""Discount"" functionality which can be applied on a page-by-page basis, for each page separately.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>Anything I need to know about payment gateways?</h2><p></p><p>Product page widget and Pre-Purchase offers are added to the original cart and can be paid for using any payment method available on your Shopify Checkout.</p><p>Post-Purchase offers are designed so that the customer does not have to enter their payment information a second time to accept the offer.</p><p></p><p>This means we are limited to Shopify’s supported payment methods which can be tokenized: Direct Credit Processors, Shopify Payments, Shop Pay and PayPal Express. More information on what’s supported for Post-Purchase offers can befound here.</p><a href=""https://help.zipify.com/en/articles/4684879-supported-payment-processors-for-post-purchase-offers-ocu"">found here</a><p></p><p>Thank you Page offers are added to the final page of the Shopify checkout to be paid for. This means the customer can pay for that item using any payment method that is available on your Shopify checkout.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>What about Shopify Gift Cards?</h2><p></p><p>If the customer pays for their entire order using a Shopify Gift Card, no post-purchase upsell offers can be shown at this time because Shopify does not yet support it. If the Gift Card doesn't cover the Total and the customer uses a Credit Card to pay for the remaining balance, then post-purchase upsell offers will be shown.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>What if I’m selling to different countries?</h2><p></p><p>If your customer's order is charged in a currency that is not your main currency or duties have been charged on that order, post-purchase & TY Page offers will be skipped. This is a limitation of Shopify’s checkout.Click herefor more information.</p><a href=""https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/selling-and-getting-paid-in-different-currencies"">Click here</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>What about purchase tracking? Is the main purchase still tracked on the Shopify Order confirmation page?</h2><p></p><p>For natively integrated analytic services that use the Shopify Pixel API (such as Google Analytics, Facebook, Pinterest and Snap) the purchase event and value for the initial purchase will be recorded when the first post-purchase page loads.</p><p>For all other tracking services, you can use the additional scripts field of the Shopify admin to add scripts to the Post-Purchase offer page. You’ll have to update your order status scripts when you do this and we have lots of details about thathere.</p><a href=""https://help.zipify.com/en/articles/5666522-pixel-tracking-on-the-post-purchase-page-ocu"">here</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>Does that mean I can track the purchase of Post-Purchase offers too?</h2><p></p><p>Yes. With the ""Post-purchase page"" additional scripts field within Shopify, it is possible to track post-purchase offer conversions back to 3rd party analytics.More details.</p><a href=""https://help.zipify.com/en/articles/5666522-pixel-tracking-on-the-post-purchase-page-ocu"">More details</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>Other stuff people ask about</h2><p>Some questions go beyond the basics, and we’ve gathered the ones we hear the most below.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>How will I get the Bonus 14-email sequence and when will I get access to them?</h2><p></p><p>You should receive the sequence after your 30-day trial for OCU is completed.</p><p>You will need some sort of email service provider (ESP) or customer relationship management (CRM) software.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>I want to use OCU, but I’m just getting started launching my business– is it a good idea to purchase OneClickUpsell if I have a new website?</h2><p></p><p>Absolutely! OCU can help you increase average order value immediately so you get the full value from every customer, right from the start.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>A significant amount of my business comes from customers on mobile devices, Is OneClickUpsell mobile responsive?</h2><p></p><p>Yes. In addition to desktops and laptops, OCU works seamlessly on tablets and smartphones as well.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>I’ve got OCU and it’s great, but I want to use another post-purchase app on my store at the same time to see how they compare, can I do that?</h2><p></p><p>Only onepost-purchase app can work on your Shopify Checkout at a time. To make OCU your active post-purchase app, select ""One Click Upsell - Zipify OCU"" in your Shopify admin ""Checkout"" settings.More details here</p><a href=""https://help.zipify.com/en/articles/5342625-oneclickupsell-native-selecting-ocu-for-your-post-purchase-page-in-shopify-admin"">More details here</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>Are there other apps that might interfere with OCU?</h2><p></p><p>There is a pre-purchase upsell incompatibility issue between OCU and apps that auto-apply discounts (Vitals, Revy, Route, etc) because they work with cart updating and discounts. We suggest usingeitherOCU pre-purchase upsellsora different bundle/pre-purchase app instead for pre-purchase offers on your store. You can still use one-click post-purchase upsell offers and the TY Page offer in both cases.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>I'm on Shopify Plus and have edited my checkout.liquid file. Will Javascript, CSS or liquid customizations I've added work on the post-purchase offer page(s)?</h2><p></p><p>No. Code customizations that are applied to the checkout.liquid file will not be inherited by the post-purchase page(s).</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>My store has a ""headless"" Shopify build and implementation, will OCU work with that setup?</h2><a href=""https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/headless-commerce"">headless</a><p></p><p>Yes and no. OCU post-purchase and TY Page offers will work with a headless implementation, since they're an extension of Shopify Checkout. Pre-purchase offers won't work though, as that offer type can only be triggered on a Shopify storefront.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>Can I upsell hidden products so customers can’t find the product in my store?</h2><p></p><p>Products have to be active and visible in your Online Store channel to be used as trigger products and upsells in OCU.  However, we do have a workaround,click herefor details in this helpful article!</p><a href=""https://help.zipify.com/en/articles/6381036-oneclickupsell-adding-offers-into-a-funnel#h_647b94821c"">click here</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>Can I use a subscription product as a trigger product?  Or how about as a post-purchase offer?</h2><p></p><p>Yes, you can! Initial orders that include a subscription product purchased on the Shopify Checkout will be shown one-click post-purchase offers that have a “one-time” product option.</p><p></p><p>As for post-purchase offers, subscription products from the ""Shopify Checkout Integration"" version of supported subscription apps can be offered as one-click post-purchase upsells, as long as the initial checkout order doesn't already contain a subscription product.Click herefor additional details.</p><a href=""https://help.zipify.com/en/articles/6249659-oneclickupsell-subscription-app-integrations"">Click here</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>Can I post-purchase upsell a physical product if only a digital product is purchased at checkout?</h2><p></p><p>Yes, technically you can. However, in this situation, the customer's shipping address wouldn't be captured at checkout so you wouldn't know where to ship the physical upsell product to, so we don't recommend that. Instead, it's recommended to only use digital products as offers for upsell funnels where digital products are added as triggers.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>Can you explain to me how billing works for my OCU subscription?</h2><p></p><p>Absolutely! We have a detailed help document that covers how billing works for OCU,Click herefor more details.</p><a href=""https://help.zipify.com/en/articles/4571658-oneclickupsell-plan-and-billing-for-your-subscription"">Click here</a><p></p><sep_token><h2>Can I use OCU on multiple Shopify stores?</h2><p></p><p>Your subscription to OneClickUpsell is good for use on only one Shopify store. If you want to use OCU on multiple Shopify stores you will need to purchase multiple subscriptions.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>What if it turns out OCU isn’t what I expected?</h2><p></p><p>OneClickUpsell comes with a 30-day free trial. If you're not delighted with the app, simply delete it from your store before the trial ends and you won't be charged.</p><p></p><sep_token><h2>What if my store isn’t using the Shopify platform, does OneClickUpsell work on eCommerce platforms other than Shopify?</h2><p></p><p>No. OneClickUpsell is an application exclusively for the Shopify platform.</p>"

Testing is relatively simple and easy to set up, making it a good starting point for testing small changes. It provides insights into the performance of the two tested variations, helping you determine which one yields better results. AB testing is suitable for optimizing single elements, but it doesn't account for interactions between multiple changes simultaneously.</p><p></p><a href=""https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/802433664/f5b066e52b41892b002f832c/image.png?expires=1724417100&signature=b046340c334ecb88d41c4a142d6aa73700ad39f3fb03c62079e96268c7e3b005""></a><img src=""https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/802433664/f5b066e52b41892b002f832c/image.png?expires=1724417100&signature=b046340c334ecb88d41c4a142d6aa73700ad39f3fb03c62079e96268c7e3b005"" alt=""Image""><p></p><p>Multi-Variant ABCDSplit Testing expands the scope by allowing you to testfour variations(A, B, C, and D) of different elements in asingle test.
